 - In this competition, our team is called "月影の传说". In the two months, we performed EDA, feature engineering, built and optimized three machine learning models, and finally used ensemble strategies to boost model performance. When the competition ends, we ranked 131 among 3852 international teams. Here I will show the report of our team for this competition, which contains the details of our competition. 
 - The current ranking is the Public Leaderboard ranking after the final submission, because the Private Leaderboard does not appear until three months after the final submission.
